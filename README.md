# How did we build this website?
- **First,** read the project in details and discussed the requirements
 together
- **Second,** searched for two APIs and read their documentation
- **Third,** drew a layout for the our website
- **Forth,** separated the team into two pairs and started working on creating the API requests
- **Fifth,** each pair worked on an API (wrote xhr request functions)
- **Sixth,** the same pair wrote the dom and render the xhr functions with the DOM file
- **Seventh,** styled our website
- **Eighth,** refactor our code
